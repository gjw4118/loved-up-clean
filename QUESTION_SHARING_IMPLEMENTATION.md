# Question Sharing Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully implemented native question sharing with deep linking, allowing users to share questions one-on-one, receive responses, and view all conversations in a new "Us" tab.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251019000000_add_question_sharing.sql`

- **`question_threads` table** - Tracks one-on-one question shares
  - Links sender, recipient, question, and status (pending/answered)
  - Automatic timestamp updates
  
- **`question_responses` table** - Stores text responses (max 1000 chars)
  - Links to thread and responder
  
- **RLS Policies** - Users can only see their own threads
- **Helper Function** - `get_user_threads()` for efficient queries

### 2. Long Press Share Gesture ✅
**File:** `src/components/cards/QuestionCardStack.tsx`

- Added `LongPressGestureHandler` (500ms hold) on question cards
- Triggers haptic feedback
- Shows native ActionSheetIOS with "Share Question" option
- Android fallback uses direct share sheet

### 3. Share Flow ✅
**File:** `src/hooks/useShareQuestion.ts`

1. User long-presses card
2. Creates thread in database
3. Generates share link: `godeeperapp://question/{threadId}`
4. Opens native share sheet with message
5. User shares via Messages, WhatsApp, etc.

### 4. "Us" Tab ✅
**Files:**
- `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Added middle tab
- `src/app/(tabs)/us.tsx` - Conversation list screen

Features:
- Shows all sent/received questions
- Status badges: "Waiting", "New", "Answered"
- Avatar with initials
- Pull to refresh
- Tap to view detail

### 5. Thread Detail Screen ✅
**File:** `src/app/threads/[threadId].tsx`

- Displays question card
- Shows sender/recipient info
- Response text area for recipients (pending threads only)
- Character counter (0/1000)
- Success state after submission
- "Waiting for response" state for senders

### 6. Deep Linking Infrastructure ✅
**Files:**
- `src/lib/linking/deepLinkHandler.ts` - URL parsing & navigation
- `src/utils/sharing/generateShareLink.ts` - Link generation
- `src/utils/sharing/parseShareLink.ts` - Thread ID extraction
- `src/app/_layout.tsx` - Deep link listeners

Handles 3 app states:
- **Closed** - Opens to thread after auth
- **Background** - Navigates to thread
- **Active** - Navigates to thread

Saves pending links if user not authenticated.

### 7. React Query Hooks ✅
**Files:**
- `src/hooks/useSharedQuestions.ts` - Fetch all user threads
- `src/hooks/useQuestionThread.ts` - Single thread with mutations
- `src/hooks/useShareQuestion.ts` - Share logic

Auto-refresh, caching, optimistic updates.

### 8. TypeScript Types ✅
**Files:**
- `src/types/sharing.ts` - Sharing-specific types
- `src/types/database.ts` - Updated with new tables

### 9. Universal Links Config ✅
**File:** `app.json`

- iOS: `associatedDomains` for `godeeper.app`
- Android: `intentFilters` for https links
- Custom scheme: `godeeperapp://`

## How to Test

### 1. Run Migration
```bash
# Apply the database migration
supabase db push

# Or via Supabase dashboard SQL Editor
# Copy/paste: supabase/migrations/20251019000000_add_question_sharing.sql
```

### 2. Test Local Deep Links
```bash
# iOS Simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted "godeeperapp://question/test-thread-id"

# Android Emulator
adb shell am start -W -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "godeeperapp://question/test-thread-id"
```

### 3. Test Share Flow
1. Start app in simulator
2. Navigate to any deck
3. Long-press on question card (hold for 500ms)
4. Action sheet appears
5. Tap "Share Question"
6. Native share sheet appears with generated message

### 4. Test in Production (Two Devices)
1. Device A: Long-press card → Share via Messages
2. Device B: Receive message → Tap link
3. Device B: App opens (or prompts install) → Auth → Thread detail
4. Device B: Type response → Submit
5. Device A: Check "Us" tab → See answered response

## Next Steps

### For Universal Links to Work (Production)

1. **Set up apple-app-site-association file**
   ```json
   {
     "applinks": {
       "apps": [],
       "details": [{
         "appID": "YOUR_TEAM_ID.com.lovedup.app",
         "paths": ["/question/*"]
       }]
     }
   }
   ```
   Host at: `https://godeeper.app/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`

2. **Set up assetlinks.json for Android**
   ```json
   [{
     "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
     "target": {
       "namespace": "android_app",
       "package_name": "com.lovedup.app",
       "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["YOUR_SHA256"]
     }
   }]
   ```
   Host at: `https://godeeper.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json`

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Push notifications (when question received/answered)
- [ ] Voice/video responses
- [ ] Group question sharing
- [ ] Question templates
- [ ] Reminders for unanswered questions
- [ ] Analytics for shared questions

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Supabase Environment Variables Required**
- The app requires `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- All sharing functions have null checks and will throw clear errors if Supabase is not configured
- Set up `.env.local` with your credentials

⚠️ **Deep Links Work Immediately**
- Custom scheme `godeeperapp://` works without any server setup
- Universal Links (`https://godeeper.app/...`) require AASA file on your domain

⚠️ **RLS Policies**
- Users can only see threads where they are sender or recipient
- Recipients can only respond to threads they received
- All database operations are secured
