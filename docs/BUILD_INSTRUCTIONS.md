# 📱 Development Build Instructions

## 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ Development server is running
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ EAS CLI configured
- ✅ You're logged in as `gjw411`

## 🏗️ **Create Development Build**

You need to run these commands **manually in your terminal** (they require interactive input):

### **Step 1: Initialize EAS Project**
```bash
cd /Users/gregwoulfe/loved-up-clean
npx eas project:init
```
- Answer "Yes" to create a project for `@gjw411/loved-up-clean`

### **Step 2: Choose Your Build Type**

#### **Option A: iOS Simulator (Recommended for Testing)**
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile ios-simulator
```
- Fastest option
- No Apple Developer account needed
- Perfect for UI testing and development

#### **Option B: Physical iOS Device**
```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile development
```
- Requires Apple Developer account
- Can test on your actual device
- Better for real-world testing

#### **Option C: Android Device**
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile development
```
- No Google Play account needed for development
- Can install APK directly

## 📋 **What Each Build Includes**

Your development build will have:
- ✅ All your dependencies (gesture handler, linear gradient, etc.)
- ✅ Glass morphism design system
- ✅ Authentication system (Google/Apple)
- ✅ Tab navigation with haptics
- ✅ Development tools for debugging

## ⏱️ **Build Time Expectations**

- **iOS Simulator**: ~5-10 minutes
- **iOS Device**: ~10-15 minutes  
- **Android**: ~8-12 minutes

## 📱 **After Build Completes**

### **For iOS Simulator:**
1. Download the `.tar.gz` file from EAS
2. Extract and drag to iOS Simulator
3. Launch the app

### **For Physical Device:**
1. EAS will provide a QR code or download link
2. Install on your device
3. Trust the developer certificate (iOS)

## 🔧 **Alternative: Local Development**

If you want to test immediately without waiting for a build:

### **iOS Simulator (Local)**
```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

### **Android Emulator (Local)**
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

**Note**: Local builds may have some limitations with native dependencies.

## 🎯 **Recommended Approach**

1. **Start with iOS Simulator build** - fastest and most reliable
2. **Test your UI and core functionality**
3. **Create device build** when ready for real-world testing

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- Your development server must keep running during testing
- Development builds include debugging tools
- You can update your app by refreshing (no need to rebuild for JS changes)

**Ready to build!** Run the commands above in your terminal to create your development build.
