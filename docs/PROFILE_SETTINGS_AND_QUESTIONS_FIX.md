# Profile Settings UI & Questions Database Fix

## Summary

This document outlines the improvements made to the profile/settings screen and fixes for the deck questions database issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Settings UI Improvements (NO EMOJIS)

#### Removed All Emojis
- ✅ Removed all emojis from ProfileSettings component
- ✅ Removed all emojis from Settings screen
- ✅ Clean, professional UI with HeroUI Native components

#### Enhanced UI Components
- ✅ Integrated HeroUI Native components (Avatar, Card, Chip, Divider, Button, Switch)
- ✅ Added expo-blur (BlurView) for glass morphism effects
- ✅ Enhanced LinearGradient backgrounds with theme-aware colors
- ✅ Improved tabs component with glass effects and haptic feedback

#### Settings Structure
**Profile Tab:**
- Large gradient avatar with first initial
- Display name and email (read-only)
- Account status badge (Premium/Free)
- Member since date
- Language preference
- Auto-sync note from Apple ID

**Settings Tab:**
- Focus Mode section with native Switch toggle
- Appearance section (theme follows device)
- Notifications section (link to device settings)
- Privacy & Legal section (policy links)
- Account section (Sign Out and Delete Account buttons)

### 2. Database Schema Fixes

#### Problem Identified
- Database only had 4 deck categories: 'friends', 'family', 'romantic', 'professional'
- App expected 5 categories: 'friends', 'family', 'dating', 'growing', 'spice'
- Each deck only had 25 questions (app expects 50-80)
- Spice deck didn't exist, causing database errors

#### Solution Created
**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20250117000000_fix_deck_categories_and_add_questions.sql`

This migration:
1. Updates category enum to include all 5 categories
2. Maps old categories to new ones (romantic → dating, professional → growing)
3. Creates all 5 decks with proper IDs matching the app constants
4. Adds `is_premium` column to question_decks table
5. Marks spice deck as premium
6. Seeds 10 questions per deck as a starting point
7. Updates question counts for all decks

### 3. Comprehensive Question Seeding Script

**Script:** `scripts/seed-comprehensive-questions.js`

This script:
- Provides 50+ questions for Friends deck
- Provides 50+ questions for Family deck
- Provides 20+ questions for Dating deck
- Provides 10+ questions for Growing deck  
- Provides 10+ questions for Spice deck
- Properly tags and categorizes all questions
- Can be run with: `npm run seed:comprehensive`

### 4. Premium Content Gating

The spice deck premium gating is already implemented in the app:
- Non-premium users are completely blocked from accessing spice deck content
- Shows premium paywall screen when attempting to access
- Other decks show first 5 questions free, then paywall for more

## How to Apply Changes

### 1. Apply the Database Migration

You have two options:

**Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/gregwoulfe/loved-up-clean
supabase db push
```

**Option B: Manual Application**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content of `supabase/migrations/20250117000000_fix_deck_categories_and_add_questions.sql`
4. Run the SQL

### 2. Seed Comprehensive Questions

```bash
npm run seed:comprehensive
```

This will populate all decks with the full question set.

### 3. Verify the Changes

```bash
node check-db.js
```

You should see:
- 5 decks (Friends, Family, Dating, Growing, Spice)
- 50+ questions for Friends and Family
- 20+ questions for Dating
- 10+ questions for Growing and Spice
- Spice deck marked as premium
