## Revenue Optimization Tips

### Pricing Strategy
- **Free tier**: Generous (all standard decks, sharing, resources)
- **Premium tier**: Clear value (intimate content + AI coach)
- **Trial**: Offer 7-day free trial on annual plan (increases conversions)

### Paywall Best Practices
1. Show value prop clearly ("Unlock deeper intimacy + AI coach")
2. Display annual savings prominently ("Save 33%")
3. Add testimonials or benefits list
4. Make free trial obvious if offered
5. "Restore Purchases" button for existing subscribers

### Conversion Optimization
- Show paywall after user shows interest (tries to open Spice)
- Don't show paywall immediately on app open
- Allow free features to demonstrate value first
- Use soft gates (preview locked content)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No offerings found"**
- Ensure products are created in RevenueCat
- Check offering is set to "current"
- Wait 5-10 minutes after creating products

**"Unable to connect to iTunes Store"**
- Check sandbox account is signed in
- Ensure products are in App Store Connect
- Wait for products to sync (can take hours)

**Premium status not updating**
- Check RevenueCat initialization
- Verify API key is correct
- Check device has internet connection

### Testing Without Real Purchases
For development, we have a `EXPO_PUBLIC_BYPASS_PREMIUM=true` flag in `.env.local` that grants premium access without payment. Remove this in production!

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create RevenueCat account** and configure products
2. **Add API keys** to `.env.local`
3. **Implement premium gates** (I'll code this)
