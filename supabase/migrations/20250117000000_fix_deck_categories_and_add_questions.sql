-- Fix deck categories and add missing decks/questions
-- Update category enum to match app expectations

-- 1. Drop the old CHECK constraint
ALTER TABLE question_decks DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS question_decks_category_check;

-- 2. Add new CHECK constraint with correct categories
ALTER TABLE question_decks ADD CONSTRAINT question_decks_category_check 
  CHECK (category IN ('friends', 'family', 'dating', 'growing', 'spice'));

-- 3. Update existing decks to match new categories
UPDATE question_decks SET category = 'dating' WHERE category = 'romantic';
UPDATE question_decks SET category = 'growing' WHERE category = 'professional';

-- 4. Delete old decks if they exist (we'll recreate with proper IDs)
DELETE FROM questions WHERE deck_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM question_decks WHERE category IN ('friends', 'family', 'dating', 'growing')
);
DELETE FROM question_decks WHERE category IN ('friends', 'family', 'dating', 'growing', 'spice');

-- 5. Create the 5 main decks with specific IDs that match the constants
INSERT INTO question_decks (id, name, description, category, icon, question_count, is_active) VALUES
  ('friends-deck', 'Friends', 'Fun social questions for friends - create memorable moments and deepen friendships', 'friends', 'üë•', 0, true),

BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
                 WHERE table_name = 'question_decks' AND column_name = 'is_premium') THEN
